# Poker Dealer

*A tool for offline Texas Hold'em dealing.*

### Usage:

1. Open the website: [cmu-poker.herokuapp.com](https://cmu-poker.herokuapp.com).

2. Input the room id, join or create a room.

3. Share the room id or the room url with your friends. Let your friends use their mobile phones open the website and join the room. *(Yes, after you created the room, share the url from your browser. Your friends will join the room automatically when they open this url.)*

4. For those who want to sit and play, click the Play button.

5. You can put an iPad in the middle of your table to act as the dealer. You should not click Play button on iPad, because the iPad is just a dealer instead of a player.

6. You can click Leave/Play button to switch between onlooker and player.

7. The Reset button means cancel current game and start from scratch.

8. If you want to hide/show your hole cards, click the Flip button.

9. Click the Deal button. That's all, enjoy! **(Attention: Although everyone could click the Deal button, we strongly recommend only one member click it.)**

*P.S. If one of the players doesn't want to play anymore, just close the website, the `Poker Dealer` will not send cards to him in the next round. And the room will be destroyed if no one in the room. Everything is in memory, we don't store anything.*
